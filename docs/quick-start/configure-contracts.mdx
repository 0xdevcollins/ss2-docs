# Configure Contracts

The `Configure Contracts` page allows you to pull existing contracts from the Starknet network and incorporate them into your Scaffold-Stark 2 project. This makes it easier to reuse deployed contracts, enabling efficient project setup.

### **Getting Started**:

### ** Accessing the Configure Contracts Page**

To access the page, navigate to the top of the screen and click on Configure Contracts. This will open a new interface where you can search for and import contracts.

### How to Use the Configure Contracts Page

#### 1. Search for Contracts

Once on the page, you’ll find an interface to search for contracts deployed on the Starknet network. You can search using:

- Contract Address
- Contract Name

Always make sure the contract address is correct and that you are searching on the right network.

#### 2. Select the Desired Contract

After entering the contract details, click `Search`. The page will retrieve the contract's information from the network and display relevant details, including its ABI.

```bash
const contract = new starknet.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress, provider);
```

#### 3. Download and Integrate the Contract

Once you’ve identified the contract, click Download Contract to pull it into your project. The DownloadContracts component will integrate the contract into your Scaffold-Stark 2 setup.

To integrate an existing DeFi contract into your project. Follow these steps:

- Search for the contract by its address.
- Pull the contract using the Download Contracts interface.
- Add the contract to your project using the following code:

```bash
const contract = new starknet.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress, provider);
```
