# Importing other contracts

The `Configure Contracts` page allows you to pull existing contracts from the Starknet network and incorporate them into your `Scaffold-Stark 2` project.
It generates a configuration file that can be used to replace or append to your local predeployedContracts.ts or configExternalContracts.ts file, enabling contract debugging in the `/debug` page of your Scaffold-Stark project.

### **Getting Started**:

### ** Accessing the Configure Contracts Page**

To access the page, navigate to the bottom of the screen and click on Configure Contracts. This will open a new interface where you can search for and import contracts.

### How to Use the Configure Contracts Page

#### 1. Chain Selection in `scaffold.config.ts`

The contracts pulled from the network are determined by the chain configured in the `scaffold.config.ts` file. This configuration decides whether you are interacting with the Sepolia or Mainnet network.

- If `Sepolia` is configured, contracts will be fetched from the `Sepolia testnet`.
- If `Mainnet` is configured, contracts will be fetched from the `Mainnet network`.

**Note:**
While some contracts may have the same address on both `Sepolia and Mainnet`, this is not always guaranteed. Always double-check you are on the correct network based on the contract's intended usage.

```ts
export type ScaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: readonly chains.Chain[];
  pollingInterval: number;
  onlyLocalBurnerWallet: boolean;
  rpcProviderUrl: string;
  walletAutoConnect: boolean;
};

const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [chains.devnet],
  // Only show the Burner Wallet when running on devnet
  onlyLocalBurnerWallet: false,
  rpcProviderUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL || "",
  // The interval at which your front-end polls the RPC servers for new data
  // it has no effect if you only target the local network (default is 30_000)
  pollingInterval: 30_000,
  /**
   * Auto connect:
   * 1. If the user was connected into a wallet before, on page reload reconnect automatically
   * 2. If user is not connected to any wallet:  On reload, connect to burner wallet if burnerWallet.enabled is true && burnerWallet.onlyLocal is false
   */
  walletAutoConnect: true,
} as const satisfies ScaffoldConfig;

export default scaffoldConfig;
```

#### 2. Enter the Contract Address and Name

- Once on the page, in the designated input fields, enter the contract address and contract name.

- These values are required to locate the contract on the network and pull the relevant details (ABI, address, classHash).

Always make sure the contract address is correct and that you are searching on the right network.

#### 3. Click the "Download Contract File" Button

After entering the details, click the `Download Contract File` button.

This will fetch the contract information (ABI, address, and classHash) from the configured network (either Sepolia or Mainnet, as set in the scaffold.config.ts file).

#### 4. Generate and Download the Configuration File

The tool will generate a configuration file that includes:

- Contract ABI
- Contract Address
- Class Hash

```ts
export const externalContracts = [
  {
    address: "0x1234...",
    abi: [...], // Contract ABI here
    classHash: "0x5678..."
  }
];
```

#### 5. Replace or Append the Configuration File

- Download the file and replace or append its contents to your local `configExternalContracts.ts` file. This file is used to register external contracts that you want to interact with in your project.

Alternatively, if you're working with pre-deployed contracts, you can modify the `predeployedContracts.ts` file.

#### 6. Use the /debug Page

- With the updated contract configuration file, navigate to the `/debug page` in your project.

You can interact with and test the contract using the `Scaffold-Stark hooks` and `utilities` here.
